Welcome to ShinyMUD, a text-based Multi-User-Dungeon from the silly folks at
Incendiary Software.

-- Software Requirements --

To run ShinyMUD you'll need:
* Python, version 2.5 or higher
* A Unix-based operating system (Linux, MacOSX)

If you're developing ShinyMUD, you'll also want Nose for running unit tests.
See http://shiny.game-host.org/wiki/UnitTesting for more details.

-- Starting ShinyMUD --

1) Open a terminal and cd to the shinymud directory (the directory this README file is in).

2) Run the following command: python src/shinymud/main.py start

ShinyMUD will start running on the default port of 4111. You can change the
port number (as well as lots of other things) in: src/data/config.py
